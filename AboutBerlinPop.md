### Exploring the Population of Berlin, Germany

This application is based on data from [berlin open data](http://daten.berlin.de/). 

The [population data](https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/opendata/EWR_Ortsteile_2014-12-31.csv) and the geographical data about [districts](https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/opendata/RBS_OD_BEZ_1412.zip) and [charters](https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/opendata/RBS_OD_ORT_1412.zip) of Berlin are published by the Amt f√ºr Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg.

The app is part of the work for the Coursera Developing Data Product Course.

It consists of two pages. The first one displays a population pyramid where you can oppose the absolut numbers of age groups, divided by gender and nationality. The second displays the percentage of foreign people on a map of Berlin in each quarter. Both pages give the choice to subset the data by age groups and districts.
